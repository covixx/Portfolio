summary: 'The good, the bad and the ugly of Zig and its ecosystem.'
---

Over the last 6 weeks, I've written about ~2500 lines of Zig code across two projects. These are my takeaways, as someone who's never written a systems language seriously before.

## The case for Zig

Zig posits itself as the 'C killer'. While I don't entirely agree with its reasoning, I respect the ambition. Many of the headaches that are second nature in C - CMake, macros, et c. - Zig tries to fix from the start. The build system in Zig is second to none. It's intuitive, malleable and cross-compiles out of the box. Macros are replaced by comptime ints, which have no size and can not be accessed at runtime. The biggest selling point though in my opinion is how readable, simplistic and easy to pick up the language is. As someone who's never written any significant systems code before, and has limited coding experience in general, I can look at most Zig repositories and figure out what's going on. This is in stark contrast to my Rust experience, where the ugliness and the stiffness of the language pushed me away for the longest time. 

## The good
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \>  Zig's memory management system is as clear-cut as it gets: You initialise an allocator, and then you get to decide who gets memory, and where. You are the memory zenith. As one hand gives, the other hand defers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \> Zig is type-safe, but allows you to coerce variables. This has been a useful feature for me, as it makes passing variables to C libraries such as raylib significantly easier.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \>  The std library in Zig is chock-full of wonderful built-in features and functions, from hashmaps to buffered prints to kernel operations.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \> The interop with C libraries makes it a trivial matter to use any and all C libraries, which is a gamechanger as the C ecosystem is magnitudes more mature than Zig's. Several are built-in, but importing the others is just as easy. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \> I've mentioned readability and ease of use before, but it still impresses me a month later how easy it is to just do things in Zig.<br /> 


## The bad, and the ugly

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \> The ecosystem is barren. It's not a fault of the language, but simply a byproduct of its age and the limited resources the community has. If you wish to do anything complicated, you will need to either do it by hand, or import a C library. For example, Zig doesnt have a de-facto GUI library like C/C++ do. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  \> The language is still pre-alpha, trying to migrate from LLVM, and has bi-yearly release cycles. This means a lot of the code you write is going to keep breaking until there's a stable version of Zig, which doesn't seem likely before late 2025. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  \> There's no async (yet). I personally haven't found this to be a significant problem so far ; maybe that's just skill issues.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  \> The lack of resources is a pain in the ass if you get stuck doing something hard. Due to the ever-evolving nature of the language, LLMs and online resources simply can't keep up. A lot of the answers I looked at whenever I got stuck were already outdated. This is slowly improving thanks to the online communities (mainly Discord and Twitter) but I suspect it will stay this way until there's a stable release.
 

## Zig's future

Personally, I think Zig is here to stay. It might not be the dramatic C killer Andrew Kelley and the gang were hoping for, but it will find its place between C and Rust, as a systems language with an incredible build system, is easy to pick up, and does everything C does but better - a C plus plus, you might say. And if you want to dip your toes in, there's a convenient starting point with Ziglings. 

There's just too much to like, and too little to dislike that is inherent to the language itself for it to fail.
